# Salma.in Blog / Website

[![View on the Web]](salma-blog.vercel.app)

My blog written in Astro, * the pages are written in .astro, and the blogs are written in markdown.
Currently, a WIP.

### To-do:

P0:

~~1. Add the rest of the pages.~~

~~2. Copy over the content from current salma.in.~~

P1:

1. Update the MenuIcon to use one SVG with 2 different paths - One for open and one for close instead of using 2 different SVGs.
2. Use a better (clarity) photo for the landing page.
3. Show only the 3 recent posts and add a view all posts button next to it which redirects to /posts. (I don't think I want this page in the navbar.)

P2:

1. Publish it (and soon).
2. Custom domain!

P3:

1. Add Work Experience, Projects and Skills to the landing page, *dedicated Portfolio with Tech Stack
2. Add a Topmate page allowing user to click on Buy Now.
3. Set up a AIKB soon, digital garden with tags and categories for all bits.
